# Our research

The Hong Kong Polytechnic University Jockey Club STEM Lab of Genomics in Healthcare is dedicated to transforming biomedical research through the seamless integration of artificial intelligence, genomics, and experimental biology. We combine interdisciplinary expertise in AI, data science, genomics, molecular biology, and neuroscience. The research projects in the Lab are funded by over HKD 80 million from:

## Biology, Genetics and Genomics

<div class="col-md-7 order-md-2">

The work in the Zhang lab in this broad field is mainly computational and falls into the category of Data Sciences (or Big Data). We aim to find and understand biological “stories” through building models and identifying patterns from large quantities of genome-scale biological data. In the process, we integrate the bench work of molecular biology and develop novel methods and efficient software tools along the way. In this broad area, we pursue two overarching themes, **<span style="color:blue; font-weight:bold; font-style:italic;">network systems biology</span>** and **<span style="color:blue; font-weight:bold; font-style:italic;">gene regulation via noncoding RNA genes</span>**. We are interested in basic biological questions (e.g., the biogenesis of small noncoding RNAs, transcriptional and post-transcriptional gene regulation) and their applications to complex diseases (e.g., Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and psoriasis) and plant stress response (e.g., rice blast and rice bacterial blight).

### Flagship Project: Redefining Psychiatric Disorders

<div class="col-md-7 order-md-1 ">

Utilizing artificial intelligence to integrate vast genomic variant datasets with brain imaging, we are redefining psychiatric disease subtypes and identifying corresponding molecular and neuroanatomical markers.
Employing advanced mouse models alongside cutting-edge single-cell and spatial transcriptomics, we are dissecting how environmental stressors trigger and exacerbate psychiatric conditions, thereby illuminating both the molecular and heritable aspects of these disorders.
The molecular markers and redefined disease classifications derived from our research are directly applied to clinical practice. Leveraging AI—including large language models—we are developing automated systems to generate personalized treatment regimens, bridging the gap between laboratory discoveries and patient care.

### Dedication
<div class="col-md-7 order-md-2">

Our laboratory is at the forefront of merging artificial intelligence with biomedical technology to address some of the most pressing challenges in modern medicine. By integrating computational innovation with rigorous experimental validation, we aim not only to advance our understanding of disease mechanisms but also to drive the development of personalized diagnostic and therapeutic strategies. Our early successes in psychiatric disorders and cancer underscore the potential of our interdisciplinary approach to yield transformative insights and clinical breakthroughs.
