# Our research
The Hong Kong Polytechnic University Jockey Club STEM Lab of Genomics in Healthcare is dedicated to transforming biomedical research through the seamless integration of artificial intelligence, genomics, and experimental biology. Under the leadership of Professor Zhang Weixiong—Chair Professor of Systems Biology and Artificial Intelligence and Vice President of the Graduate School—we combine interdisciplinary expertise in AI, data science, genomics, molecular biology, and neuroscience. Supported by the Hong Kong Government’s Global Talent Recruitment Scheme, our institution, and the Hong Kong Jockey Club, our work is backed by over HKD 80 million in funding.

    <h3>A Convergence of Computation and Experimentation</h3>
    <p>
      Our laboratory bridges the gap between “dry” computational analyses and “wet” laboratory experimentation. With access to state-of-the-art supercomputing facilities and advanced biomedical instrumentation, we employ innovative deep learning and large language models to decode complex genetic architectures. Our research targets fundamental challenges in genetics and molecular biology—such as deciphering noncoding gene regulation and performing comprehensive genome-wide association studies—to reveal novel molecular signatures underlying disease.

    <h3>Innovative Approaches to Complex Diseases</h3>
    <p>
      We apply our integrated methodologies to unravel the pathogenesis of multifaceted conditions, including psychiatric disorders (such as depression and schizophrenia) and cancer. In just over two years, our team has secured more than HKD 90 million in project support, including two major thematic research initiatives. Our efforts have led to the identification of key genetic variants and neuroimaging biomarkers that redefine traditional disease classifications and open new avenues for precision medicine.

    <h3>Flagship Project: Redefining Psychiatric Disorders</h3>
    <p>
      Utilizing artificial intelligence to integrate vast genomic variant datasets with brain imaging, we are redefining psychiatric disease subtypes and identifying corresponding molecular and neuroanatomical markers.
      Employing advanced mouse models alongside cutting-edge single-cell and spatial transcriptomics, we are dissecting how environmental stressors trigger and exacerbate psychiatric conditions, thereby illuminating both the molecular and heritable aspects of these disorders.
      The molecular markers and redefined disease classifications derived from our research are directly applied to clinical practice. Leveraging AI—including large language models—we are developing automated systems to generate personalized treatment regimens, bridging the gap between laboratory discoveries and patient care.

    <h3>Dedication</h3>
    <p>
      Our laboratory is at the forefront of merging artificial intelligence with biomedical technology to address some of the most pressing challenges in modern medicine. By integrating computational innovation with rigorous experimental validation, we aim not only to advance our understanding of disease mechanisms but also to drive the development of personalized diagnostic and therapeutic strategies. Our early successes in psychiatric disorders and cancer underscore the potential of our interdisciplinary approach to yield transformative insights and clinical breakthroughs.
